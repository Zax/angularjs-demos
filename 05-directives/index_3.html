	Esempio di isolation scope

	The scope option is an object that contains a property for each isolate scope binding. In this case it has just one property:

	- Its name (customerInfo) corresponds to the directive's isolate scope property customerInfo.
	- Its value (=info) tells $compile to bind to the info attribute.

	As the name suggests, the isolate scope of the directive isolates everything except models that you've explicitly added to the scope: {} hash object. 
	This is helpful when building reusable components because it prevents a component from changing your model state except for the models that you explicitly pass in.

	Note: These =attr attributes in the scope option of directives are normalized just like directive names. 
	To bind to the attribute in <div bind-to-this="thing">, you'd specify a binding of =bindToThis.
